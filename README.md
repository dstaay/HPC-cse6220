Presentation of Udacity Final Project for UD820 (same lecturers as GA Tech CS7641)

It implements the MDP logic, building on base code fround here: pushkar/ud820-proj

Most of my code is in ValueIterationAgent.py and qlearningAgents.py

To demonstrate output I have included a quick test of 300 learning trials, to run:

>> py pacman.py -p PacmanQAgent -x 300 -n 310 -l smallGrid

Also includes screen shot of output [Pacman Test Output 300 Learning.GIF]  
and 3 videos of trails post training [Pacman 300 Learning Video X.MP4]

As trails approach 2000, win ratio trends to 100%
